1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:01,721
This is ErgoSNM

2
00:00:01,746 --> 00:00:04,966
a split mechanical keyboard with an integrated trackball

3
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:08,999
This video will introduce the basic functions of the ErgoSNM

4
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,798
By pressing the left or right Fn key

5
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:13,365
you can switch to layer 2

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,495
which provides additional key functions

7
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:17,030
In layer 2

8
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,697
you can enter numbers using only your left hand

9
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,799
allowing your right hand to control the cursor

10
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:23,696
You can also adjust the volume

11
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,862
I placed the arrow keys on H J K L

12
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,195
just like in Vim

13
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:29,561
If you don't use Vim

14
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,561
this layout might feel unintuitive

15
00:00:31,856 --> 00:00:36,027
But that's okay. You can customize any key using Vial to match your preference

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,260
Next are the mouse functions

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,592
press J & K to perform a left-click

18
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,292
K & L for a right-click

19
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,925
and J & L for a middle-click

20
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:46,625
The trackball is controlled with your thumb

21
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,024
allowing you to move the cursor while keeping your right hand on the home row

22
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:51,957
when you hold the Fn key

23
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:53,957
the trackball switches to scroll mode

24
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,789
enabling vertical scrolling

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,422
Alternatively, holding J & L also activates scroll mode

26
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:04,288
This means you can perform most mouse operations using only your right hand
